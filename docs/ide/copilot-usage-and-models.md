# Copilot usage and models in Visual Studio

GitHub Copilot now follows a [new billing model](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests). With this update that impacts usage and billing for [premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests#premium-requests), Visual Studio has introduced new features to help you better manage your Copilot usage and the models you work with.

## What's changed?

If you‚Äôre a **paid Copilot user**, your plan now includes a **[monthly allowance of premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/plans-for-github-copilot#comparing-copilot-plans)**. These requests are used whenever you interact with Copilot using premium models, like Claude Sonnet 3.7. Once you reach your quota, Copilot in Visual Studio automatically switches to a base model, ensuring uninterrupted workflow.

For users on **Copilot Free**, your account comes with up to 2,000 code completions and up to 50 chats or premium requests per month.

## What‚Äôs new in Visual Studio?

New tools and smarter defaults make it easier to track usage and get the most out of Copilot.

### Smarter default models

Visual Studio now defaults to **GPT-4.1**, a fast and balanced model. If you exhaust your premium quota, it automatically switches to the **fallback model**, ensuring uninterrupted access to powerful features at no extra cost.

> üí° Once you select a model, it stays active for your current chat session‚Äîno need to reselect it between threads.

### Smarter usage insights

To track your Copilot usage:

1. Select the **Copilot badge** in the top-right corner of Visual Studio.
2. Select **Copilot Consumptions**.

Here, you can view your usage across chat, auto (agent) mode, and other features. You can also select **Get more requests** to update your subscription or adjust Overage settings directly on *GitHub.com*.

### Smarter fallback behavior

- **Overages ON**: You can keep using premium models beyond your monthly quota, with any extra usage billed to your account.
- **Overages OFF**: Copilot automatically switches to the fallback model once you reach your quota, preventing unexpected charges.

To control model usage in non-chat interactions, configure the setting **Enhance non-chat requests with premium models** in **GitHub** > **Copilot** > **Editor**.

### Easier model management

Use the updated **model picker** experience.

> If a model is supported by your plan but not yet enabled, Visual Studio prompts you to activate it‚Äîno need to leave the IDE.

- Gemini 2.0 Flash

## Frequently asked questions

#### Do Completions count as premium requests?

**Code completions** do *not* count against your premium request balance for paid users.

#### What are premium requests?

Some Copilot features use more advanced processing power and count as premium requests. See [premium requests and premium features](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests#premium-requests) to learn more.

#### Who can purchase additional premium requests?

To learn more, see [Additional premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests#additional-premium-requests).

#### How is premium request usage assessed?

Premium request usage is based on the [model‚Äôs multiplier](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests#model-multipliers) and the feature you‚Äôre using. To learn more, see [Example of premium request usage](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests#example-of-premium-request-usage.)
