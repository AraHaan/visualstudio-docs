# How Copilot Chat understands and uses context

Copilot Chat in Visual Studio is designed to be context-aware, delivering highly relevant and tailored responses by deeply understanding your projectâ€™s structure and content. This article provides a behind-the-scenes look at how Copilot Chat constructs and utilizes context to enhance your coding workflow.

## How Copilot Chat gathers solution context

Copilot Chat uses a multi-layered approach to context-building within your codebase to ensure its suggestions and answers are relevant and accurate.

### Codebase indexing

If your repository is hosted on GitHub or Azure DevOps, Copilot creates a remote index of your codebase and computes an embedding that captures patterns and relationships in your code. Learn more about [remote indexing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/about-github-code-search).

If your code is hosted elsewhere, Copilot builds a local index.

### Semantic search

Based on your prompt, Copilot may determine that it needs more project context to respond accurately. In such cases, it performs a semantic search on the remote or local index.

Unlike traditional search, which matches exact words, semantic search focuses on meaning. Using advanced vector embeddings, Copilot identifies files with the highest semantic similarity to your request and adds them to its context.

These files supplement the system prompt, instructions, implicit context (such as chat history and open files), and any explicit content you provide, like errors.

## How Copilot Chat applies code auggestions

Copilot Chat frequently provides code suggestions in its responses. These suggestions must be accurately mapped to your codebase before they can be applied and tested.

### Model based code mapping

Copilot Chat uses speculative decoding to accurately insert suggestions into existing files, reducing the risk of errors. In Agent mode, this enables Copilot to make reliable edits that support building, debugging, and testing your code independently.
