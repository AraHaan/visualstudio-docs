# What is GitHub Copilot Agent?

With GitHub Copilot's agent mode in Visual Studio, you can use natural language to specify a high-level task. AI will then autonomously reason through the request, plan the work needed, and apply the changes to your codebase. Agent mode combines code editing and tool invocation to accomplish the task you specified. As it processes your request, it monitors the outcome of edits and tools, and iterates to resolve any issues that arise.

The key difference from Copilot Chat is that agent mode can:

1) Run commands and builds to interpret the environment or execute a task (for example, database migrations, dotnet restore, etc.).
2) Iterate on errors, failed builds, or unit test results until it either requires additional input or considers the task complete.

## Prerequisites

+ [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-history) or later.
    + Set **Enable agent mode in the chat pane** in **Tools** > **Options** > **GitHub** > **Copilot**.
+ [Sign in to Visual Studio using a GitHub account](work-with-github-accounts.md) with [Copilot access](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot). <br/>
    + You can use [GitHub Copilot for Free](copilot-free-plan.md). Sign up and leverage AI to code faster and more efficiently.

## Use agent mode

In agent mode, Copilot operates autonomously and determines the relevant context for your prompt.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Enable agent mode by selecting **Enable agent mode in the chat pane** in **Tools** > **Options** > **GitHub** > **Copilot**.
   
    <!-- :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-setting-updated.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Copilot Agent Settings." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-setting-updated.png"::: -->

2. Open the Copilot Chat window, select **Ask** to expand the mode dropdown, and then select **Agent**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Copilot agent mode selector." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-dropdown.png":::

3. Enter your prompt for making edits in the chat input field and select **Send** or press **Enter** to submit it. You can specify a high-level requirement, and you don't have to specify which files to work on. In agent mode, Copilot determines the relevant context and the files to edit autonomously.

4. Agent mode might invoke multiple tools to accomplish different tasks. Optionally, select the **Tools** icon to configure which additional tools can be used for responding to your request.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows additional tools used by agent mode." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-tools.png":::

5. Confirm tool invocations and terminal commands. Before running a terminal command or a non-builtin tool, Copilot requests confirmation to continue. This is because tools might run locally on your machine and perform actions that modify files or data.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-command-approval.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows agent command approval." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-command-approval.png":::

6. Copilot detects issues and problems in code edits and terminal commands, and then iterates and performs additional actions to resolve them. For example, agent mode might run unit tests as a result of a code edit. If the tests fail, it uses the test outcome to resolve the issue. Copilot agent mode iterates multiple times to resolve issues and problems.

7. As Copilot processes your request, notice that Copilot streams the suggested code edits directly in the editor. Review the suggested edits and either keep or discard the suggested edits as a whole in **Total Changes** in the chat window, or individually by clicking on a file and reviewing the code diffs presented in the editor.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-keep-undo.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the list of suggested edits." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-keep-undo.png":::

8. If you want to review individual code changes made by the agent, you can either review the specific change made at each step, or review the cumulative changes from the last time changes were kept or undone.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-cumulative-edits.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows accessing cumulative edit diffs with Copilot agent." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-cumulative-edits.png":::

9. Continue to iterate on the code changes to refine the edits or implement additional features.

## Agent mode tools

Agent mode can use the following tools:

* Built-in tools
* [MCP tools](mcp-servers.md)

You can view and manage the tools that can be used for responding to a request. Select the **Tools** icon in the chat window to view and manage the tools that are available in agent mode.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent-mcp/copilot-agent-partial-tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Copilot agent tool selector." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent-mcp/copilot-agent-partial-tools.png":::

Based on the outcome of a tool, Copilot might invoke other tools to accomplish the overall request. For example, if a code edit results in syntax errors in the file, Copilot might explore another approach and suggest different code changes.

Additional tools added by running MCP servers are not automatically enabled, they are unchecked by default and must be checked to be activated.

## Manage tool approvals

When a tool is invoked, Copilot requests confirmation to run the tool. This is because tools might run locally on your machine and perform actions that modify files or data.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-command-approval.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows tool confirmation request." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-command-approval.png":::

In the chat window, after a tool invocation, use the **Allow** dropdown options to automatically confirm the specific tool for the current session, solution, or all future invocations.

You can reset tool confirmation selections in **Tools** > **Options** > **GitHub** > **Copilot** > **Tools**.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-tool-config.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows tool confirmation options." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-tool-config.png":::

<!-- TODO: Define what "Reset solution setting does -->

## Accept or discard edits

Copilot lists the files that were edited in the list of **Total Changes** in the Chat window.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-keep-undo.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Total Changes list." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-keep-undo.png":::

Click on each file to review changes individually, where you can **Keep** or **Undo** edits made to each chunk of code.

Alternatively, in the **Total Changes** list, select **Keep** or **Undo** for all edits made since the last time you clicked **Keep** or **Undo**.

## Revert edits

As you're sending requests to make edits to your code, you might want to roll back some of these changes, for example, when you want to use another implementation strategy or if Copilot starts walking down the wrong path when generating edits. To do so, select **Restore** next to the checkpoint prior to the prompt that included changes you didn't want.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-checkpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows reverting edits." lightbox="media/vs-2022/copilot-agent/copilot-agent-checkpoint.png":::

Currently, Visual Studio Copilot Agent doesn't support stepwise undo/redo.

## Interrupt an agent mode request

To interrupt an ongoing request, you can cancel it.
This stops all running tools and terminal commands.

To stop a build, select **Build** in the top toolbar, and then select **Cancel** or use the **Ctrl + Break** keyboard shortcut.

## Frequently asked questions

### I don't see Ask and Agent mode in the GitHub Copilot Chat window.

Take the following troubleshooting steps in the order specified:
- Make sure you're using Visual Studio 17.14 or later: check the version at **Help** > **About Visual Studio**. If you're not using version 17.14 or later, launch the Visual Studio Installer and update your build.
- Make sure you've selected the **Enable agent mode in the chat pane** setting in **Tools** > **Options** > **GitHub** > **Copilot**.
- Try restarting Visual Studio.

### When to use Ask and Agent modes?

- Use Ask mode when you want full controlâ€”no code edits will be made unless you explicitly select **Apply** or copy and paste the code yourself.
- Agent mode can handle the same conceptual questions, generate code examples without applying them, along with its agent capabilities of editing code automatically.
- To use MCP capabilities, you must enable agent mode.

### What happened to Copilot Edits in Visual Studio?

- We perceive agent mode to be an evolution of Edits, with greater ability to iterate on errors, use tools, and automatically apply code changes.
- For the initial releases of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14, Edits mode is still available if you uncheck the **Enable agent mode in the chat pane** setting in **Tools** > **Options** > **GitHub** > **Copilot**.

### As an administrator, how do I control use of agent mode for Visual Studio users?

Agent mode in Visual Studio is governed by the **Editor preview features** flag in the GitHub Copilot dashboard for administrators.
