# Coming soon: Agent mode in Visual Studio

Agent mode is *coming soon* to Visual Studio. To learn more about its availability in Visual Studio, visit the [Visual Studio annoucement](https//aka.ms/vsagentmode)

With chat agent mode in Visual Studio, you'll be able to use natural language to define a high-level task and to start an agentic code editing session to accomplish that task. In agent mode, Copilot will autonomously plan the work needed and determine the relevant files and context. It'll then make edits to your codebase and invoke tools to accomplish the request you made. Agent mode monitors the outcome of edits and tools and iterates to resolve any issues that arise.
