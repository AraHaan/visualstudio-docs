## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild itself generates a fatal error while building your project. This situation could occur if MSBuild encounters an error that it wasn't expecting, such as when your system is out of memory, or it could indicate an engineering defect in MSBuild. The exception is reported after the MSBuild message text.

## Resolution

If the exception text indicates a system issue, such as an out-of-memory error, address that if you can, and then try rerunning MSBuild. For an out-of-memory issue, close open applications. On Windows, use the Task Manager to identify processes that are using up memory, and shut them down. Check for any bad processes that might be using up memory erroneously.

If the exception text isn't obviously a system issue, you can report the issue either as a Visual Studio bug, or as an MSBuild issue. See [Report a problem](../../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md) or the [MSBuild GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild).
