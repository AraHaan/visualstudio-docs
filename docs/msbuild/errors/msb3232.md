## Description

This warning occurs when MSBuild tries to remove a directory, but the directory provided to the `RemoveDir` task was an empty string. See [RemoveDir task](../removedir-task.md).

## Resolution

If you're using `RemoveDir` in your project code or your own imported MSBuild files, review the parameters for the `RemoveDir` task, and make sure they're correct. Check that any property values provided have been defined at the point of the call, and have the correct value.

To find the `RemoveDir` code that produces the error and debug its parameters, enable diagnostic logging (use the `-v:diag` command-line switch for MSBuild), or generate a binary log (use the `-bl` switch) and use the [MSBuild structured log viewer](https://msbuildlog.com).
