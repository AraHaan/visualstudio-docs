## Message text

```output
MSB1013: The response file was specified twice. A response file can be specified only once. Any files named 'msbuild.rsp' in the directory of MSBuild.exe or in the directory of the first project or solution built (which if no project or solution is specified is the current working directory) were automatically used as response files.

<!--
{StrBegin="MSBUILD : error MSB1013: "}UE: Response files are just text files that contain a bunch of command-line switches to be passed to MSBuild.exe. The
    purpose is so you don't have to type the same switches over and over again ... you can just pass in the response file instead.
    Response files can include the @ switch in order to further include other response files. In order to prevent a circular
    reference here, we disallow the same response file from being included twice. This error message would be followed by the
    exact @ switch that resulted in the duplicate response file.
    LOCALIZATION: The prefix "MSBUILD : error MSBxxxx:" should not be localized.
