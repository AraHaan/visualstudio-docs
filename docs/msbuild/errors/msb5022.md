## Message text

<!-- :::editable-content name="messageText"::: -->
`MSB5022: The MSBuild task host does not support running tasks that perform IBuildEngine callbacks. If you wish to perform these operations, please run your task in the core MSBuild process instead.  A task will automatically execute in the task host if the UsingTask has been attributed with a 'Runtime' or 'Architecture' value, or the task invocation has been attributed with an 'MSBuildRuntime' or 'MSBuildArchitecture' value, that does not match the current runtime or architecture of MSBuild.`
