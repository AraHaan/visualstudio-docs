# MSBuild error MSB8088

> MSB8088: Dynamic debugging and whole program optimization are incompatible. Disabling whole program optimization.
When you turn on [C++ Dynamic Debugging (Preview)](/visualstudio/debugger/cpp-dynamic-debugging), the build automatically turns off whole program optimization (compiler switch [`/GL`](/cpp/build/reference/gl-whole-program-optimization)). These two options are incompatible. When you enable dynamic debugging, the compiler generates information for debugging, which conflicts with the optimizations performed by whole program optimization.

To resolve this issue, turn off whole program optimization in the project properties by setting **Configuration Properties** > **Advanced** > **Whole Program Optimization** to **Off**. For more information, see [General Property Page (Project)](/cpp/build/reference/general-property-page-project).
