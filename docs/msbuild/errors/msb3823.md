# MSB3823 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3823 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3823: Non-string resources require the property GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources to be set to true.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSB3823: "}
-->
## Description

There is a difference in how non-string resources are serialized and deserialized between .NET Framework and .NET Core. In .NET Framework applications, resources are both deserialized and then preserialized, which is not efficient but was meant to handle diverse serialization and deserialization techniques. In .NET Core, the extra steps are avoided. However, you can also opt-in to preserialization for .NET Framework projects, by setting the property mentioned in the error message.

## Resolution

If you want to use preserialized resources in a .NET Framework project, you must add a reference to the [System.Resources.Extensions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Resources.Extensions) NuGet package, and also set the property `GenerateResourceUsePreserializedResources` to true.
