# MSB3202

This error occurs when MSBuild can't find a project file with the specified name at the expected location.

The full message is something like the following text:

```output
MSB3202: The project file 'filename' was not found.
```

## Remarks

The MSB3202 error occurs when MSBuild is unable to locate the specified project file. This error is generated when a build is invoked with an incorrect or missing project file path, or incorrect or missing dependent project file.

## Common causes

Here are some real-world scenarios that can lead to this error, especially in modern development and CI/CD environments:

1. **Incorrect file path in command line or build script**
   - When invoking MSBuild, the specified project file path doesn't exist or is mistyped. Check the path, especially for syntax issues such as quotes around paths with spaces.

2. **Project file renamed or deleted**
   - A project file was renamed or removed from the repository, but the build logic or one of the build inputs was not updated to reflect this change.

3. **Repository checkout issues**
   - During a CI/CD pipeline execution, the source code repository might not be fully checked out, or the necessary project file is excluded due to `.gitignore` rules or shallow cloning.

## Resolution

1. Verify that the project file exists at the specified location.
   - Use an absolute path to the project file to avoid ambiguity.
   - Example:

     `msbuild C:\Projects\MySolution\MyProject.csproj`

2. Check for typos in the ProjectReference item in the project file.

3. Ensure your version control system includes all necessary project files and that the repository checkout is complete.
