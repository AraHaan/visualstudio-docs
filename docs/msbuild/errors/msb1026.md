<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

```output
MSB1026: Schema file does not exist.
MSB1026: Schema file 'value' does not exist.
```

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSBUILD : error MSB1026: "}UE: This error is shown when the user specifies a schema file using the -validate:<schema> switch, and the file
    does not exist on disk. This message does not need in-line parameters because the exception takes care of displaying the
    invalid arg.
    LOCALIZATION: The prefix "MSBUILD : error MSBxxxx:" should not be localized.

{StrBegin="MSBUILD : error MSB1026: "}UE: This error is printed if the default schema does not exist or in the extremely unlikely event
    that an explicit schema file was passed and existed when the command line parameters were checked but was deleted from disk before this check was made.
    LOCALIZATION: The prefix "MSBUILD : error MSBxxxx:" should not be localized.
