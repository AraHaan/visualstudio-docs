# MSB1004 diagnostic code

This article describes the MSB1004 error code.

## Message text

```output
MSB1004: Specify the name of the target.
```

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
<!--
{StrBegin="MSBUILD : error MSB1004: "}UE: This happens if the user does something like "msbuild.exe -target". The user must pass in an actual target name
      following the switch, as in "msbuild.exe -target:blah".
      LOCALIZATION: The prefix "MSBUILD : error MSBxxxx:" should not be localized.
-->
## Description

This errors occurs when the MSBuild command line contains a `-targets` or `-t` switch, which is used to request a specific target to build, but no target was specified.

## Resolution

Provide the target name that you want to build. Check for typos in the command-line syntax, and make sure that the desired target name is given after the `-targets` or `-t` switch. If you're constructing the MSBuild command line using an environment variable or shell script, check that the environment variable exists, has a value, and is referenced using the correct shell-specific syntax, and verify any shell expansions, and the correct syntax of escape characters.

Possible targets might be defined in the project file itself. These appear as a `Target Name="MyTarget"` element in the project file. Or, you can specify one of the system-provided target files. These are files with the `.targets` extension such as `Microsoft.Common.targets`, `Microsoft.Common.CSharp.targets`, and so on in the MSBuild installation folders. If you're using a project SDK (for example, you used the `Sdk="Microsoft.Net.Sdk"` attribute on the `Project` node in the project file), these system `.targets` files are imported implicitly.

If you don't know what the name of your desired target is, or what target you want to build, you can get a list of available targets by issuing the command `MSBuild -targets`.

For more information, see [MSBuild targets](../msbuild-targets.md).
