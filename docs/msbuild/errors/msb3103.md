# MSB3103: Invalid Resx file

This error occurs when there/s an issue with a `.resx` resource file. When you see this error, another error is displayed with more details. Look to the other error for more information.

## Message text

`MSB3103: Invalid Resx file`

## Remarks

The error MSB3103 occurs when MSBuild encounters an invalid `.resx` file during the build process. This error indicates that the `.resx` file can't be properly read or processed, often due to incorrect file paths or references. 

## Common Causes

This error can occur in the following scenarios:

1. **Missing or Inaccessible Resources**: The `.resx` file references external resources (for example, images or files) that aren't present in the expected location or are inaccessible.
    - Example: A file path specified in the `.resx` is incorrect or points to a missing file.
2. **Incorrect type reference**: The `.resx` file referenced a type that couldn't be found.
    - Example: A typo in a type reference in a ResXFile reference, or a type that was not available for some reason.
3. **Corrupted files**: The `.resx` file or one of its dependencies was corrupted.

## Real-World Scenarios

1. **Migrating projects**: When you're upgrading a legacy project from .NET Framework to .NET Core or .NET 6+, existing `.resx` files may contain elements or attributes that are incompatible with the newer frameworks.
2. **Manual edits to `.resx` files**: Someone manually editing `.resx` files might inadvertently introduce syntax errors or invalid data.
3. **Broken resource links**: Referencing external files (for example, images or icons) in `.resx` files without ensuring these files are included in the project or accessible during the build.
4. **Corrupted `.resx` files**: Files can become corrupted due to version control conflicts or file encoding changes.

### Resolution

1. **Check Resource Entries**:
    - If external resources are referenced, verify their paths and existence.

2. **Use the ResX Resource Manager**:
    - Consider using tools like [ResX Resource Manager](https://github.com/dotnet/ResXResourceManager) to validate and manage `.resx` files.

3. **Update for Framework Compatibility**:
    - Review changes in resource handling for the target framework.
    - Update `.resx` files to align with the requirements of the new framework.

4. **Revert to a Known Good State**:
    - If the `.resx` file has become corrupted, revert to a previous version from source control.
