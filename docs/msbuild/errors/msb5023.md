## Description

This error occurs during the solution build when a nested project couldn't be parsed in the solution file, perhaps due to a syntax error or other corruption in the text of the solution file.

Note that MSBuild uses its own algorithm to parse and build solution files, so in some cases, a build can succeed in Visual Studio, but when you try to build the same solution with MSBuild, it fails.

## Resolution

Try loading the solution in Visual Studio, and then close it and try building from the MSBuild command line. Visual Studio regenerates solution files whenever they are corrupted, and so most problems in solution files can be resolved by allowing Visual Studio to rewrite the file.
