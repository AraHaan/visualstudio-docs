## Description

MSBuild generates this error when it tries to build a solution file (`.sln`) that has been corrupted and couldn't be parsed. This usually means a solution file was modified in a way that violated its expected structure and format.

## Resolution

If the solution file was edited, you can usually go back to an earlier revision before the change. You can also try opening the solution in Visual Studio to regenerate the solution file. Visual Studio can usually repair a corrupted solution file. In severe cases, you can try deleting the solution file and manually recreating it using Visual Studio.
