## Description

This error is given when MSBuild tries to open a project file that is in a format is no longer supported in the current version of Visual Studio and MSBuild. For example, projects with the extension `.vcproj` are not supported in MSBuild.

## Resolution

Open the project in Visual Studio to convert the project to a newer format. For example, in the case of `.vcproj`, Visual Studio upgrades the project and generates a `.vcxproj` file, which you can build on the MSBuild command line, or in Visual Studio.
