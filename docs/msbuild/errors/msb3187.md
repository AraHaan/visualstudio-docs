# MSB3187 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3187 diagnostic code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3187: Referenced assembly 'assembly-name' targets a different processor than the application.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This is a warning, not an error. The question is whether this is intended or not. There are times when you are targeting `Any CPU`, but you reference an assembly that targets a specific platform, where you get this warning. Your app might not run successfully on some platforms.

## Resolution

If this is intentional, you can disable the warning by using the `NoWarn` command line argument:

`-nowarn:MSB3187` or `/NoWarn:MSB3187`

Otherwise, try to use a different build of the assembly that references the correct platform.
