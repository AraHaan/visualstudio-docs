# MSB3774 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3774 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

<!-- :::editable-content name="messageText"::: -->
`MSB3774: Could not find SDK 'value'.`
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->
<!-- MSB3774: Could not find SDK "{0}". -->

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when MSBuild can't find the SDK referenced in the project file. MSBuild relies on user-extensible SDK resolvers to find SDKs. You get this error when a configured resolver can't find the requested SDK.

## Resolution

In your project file, check the root `Project` element and the `Sdk` attribute. For .NET projects, the attribute value should be `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` or a reference for NuGet. Check the spelling of the package or feed name, and the version number. Confirm the referenced NuGet feed is accessible or publicly available.

Verify that the SDK is installed correctly. Check with the SDK provider to make sure you're using the correct name to reference the SDK.

For more information, see [How to use Project SDK](../how-to-use-project-sdk.md).
