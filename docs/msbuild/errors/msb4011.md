## Description

This diagnostic code is emitted when you import the same project more than once in the same project file. This build issue isn't a blocking error.

## Resolution

Although this issue isn't a blocking error, you can remove the duplicate import element to eliminate the warning.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If an imported file uses properties and items defined in your project file, the placement of `import` elements in the code can affect the behavior of the build. It's important to understand any differences in property values or items that are used in the imported project when choosing which duplicate to remove.
