## Description

Dependent assemblies can't be built against a higher version of the .NET Framework than the version you're currently building for. 

## Resolution

Consider targeting a newer version of the .NET Framework. For a guide on resolving errors with assembly references, see [Troubleshoot assembly references](../troubleshoot-assembly-references.md).

For more information, see [MSBuild target framework and target platform](../msbuild-target-framework-and-target-platform.md) and [MSB3274](msb3274.md).
