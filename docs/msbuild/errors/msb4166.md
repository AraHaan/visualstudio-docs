## Description

The error output text is followed by the exception text, if any.

MSBuild can use multiple processes and there's a scheduler process that distributes work to the various worker nodes. If the worker process crashes without reporting an error to the scheduler, then the scheduler emits this error.

## Resolution

Check the error log in the temporary files folder in *MSBuild_{guid}.failure.txt*.

### Report error

This error usually indicates an MSBuild issue, and should be reported to Microsoft. You can report the issue in the [MSBuild GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild) or at the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/search?space=8) site.
