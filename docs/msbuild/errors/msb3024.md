# MSB3024 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3024 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

`MSB3024: Could not copy the file 'value' to the destination file 'value', because the destination is a folder instead of a file. To copy the source file into a folder, consider using the DestinationFolder parameter instead of DestinationFiles.`

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This error occurs when, in the course of the build, an operation attempts to copy a file to another location, but the destination location already contains a folder of the same name.

## Resolution

You can get more information by running MSBuild with the `-v:diag` switch. The issue could occur if some previous part of the build created the folder, so you can check the log for what part of the build process does this.

On non-Windows systems, or container builds targeting Linux containers, the destination binary doesn't have an extension. This could create a conflict if a folder exists with the same name as the executable.

You might be able to work around this build error by renaming your project or executable to avoid the name conflict.
