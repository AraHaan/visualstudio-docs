```output
MSB3249: Application Configuration file 'value' is invalid.
```

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->

### Remarks

The error MSB3249 is raised by the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task in MSBuild when an invalid or malformed application configuration file (for example, `app.config`) is detected during the build process. This usually occurs when the configuration file contains syntax errors, invalid XML, or unexpected values that prevent MSBuild from properly resolving assembly references. See [ResolveAssemblyReference task](../resolveassemblyreference-task.md).

### Possible causes

1. **Malformed or invalid XML**: The `app.config` file contains syntax errors or is not well-formed XML.
2. **Missing or incorrect `<runtime>` section**: The `app.config` file is missing the `<runtime>` element or contains invalid data in this section. See [`<runtime>` element](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element).
3. **Unrecognized configuration settings**: The file includes settings that are not supported or are incorrectly specified.
4. **File not accessible**: The `app.config` file is missing, locked, or inaccessible due to file permissions.

### Resolution

1. **Validate the `app.config` file**:
   - Open the file in an XML editor or IDE that supports XML validation.
   - Correct any syntax errors or invalid XML structure.

2. **Check for unsupported or invalid settings**:
   - Review the file for any unrecognized configuration keys or invalid values.
   - Refer to the [Configuring apps by using configuration files](/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/) for supported settings.

3. **Ensure file accessibility**:
   - Confirm that the `app.config` file exists in the expected location.
   - Ensure the build process has the necessary permissions to read the file.

The `ResolveAssemblyReference` task is responsible for resolving references to assemblies during the build process. An invalid `app.config` file can prevent this task from completing successfully. For more information on the `ResolveAssemblyReference` task, see [MSBuild ResolveAssemblyReference Task](../resolveassemblyreference-task.md).
