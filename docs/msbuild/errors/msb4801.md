## Description

This error usually occurs when you're targeting .NET Core or .NET or later, but a task was provided the `CodeTaskFactory` for the `TaskFactory` parameter in a `UsingTask` element. Every task has a task factory, which is used by MSBuild to instantiate and launch the task. For code-based tasks, .NET Framework can use the `CodeTaskFactory`, but .NET Core requires `RoslynCodeTaskFactory`.

For more information, see [RoslynCodeTaskFactory](../msbuild-roslyncodetaskfactory.md).

## Resolution

When you're targeting .NET Core or .NET 5 and later, you must use `RoslynCodeTaskFactory` instead of `CodeTaskFactory`. Note that `RoslynCodeTaskFactory` also works for .NET Framework, so you can safely update any references to `CodeTaskFactory` to `RoslynCodeTaskFactory` regardless of target framework.
