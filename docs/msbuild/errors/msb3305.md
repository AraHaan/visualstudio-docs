# MSB3305 diagnostic code

<!-- :::ErrorDefinitionDescription::: -->
<!-- :::editable-content name="introDescription"::: -->
This article describes the MSB3305 error code.
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->

## Message text

<!-- :::editable-content name="messageText"::: -->
`MSB3305: Processing COM reference 'value' from path 'value'.`
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->
<!-- MSB3305: Processing COM reference "{0}" from path "{1}". {2} -->

<!-- :::editable-content name="postOutputDescription"::: -->
## Description

This warning is a generic notification of an issue with a COM reference. Some possible causes include:

- An invalid type library (TLB file), which might be anything from a corrupt TLB file to a version mismatch.
- Types in a TLB that can't be converted to .NET types. The unconverted types are passed as pointers, which requires the use of unsafe code.

## Resolution

The standard output message text is followed by additional information from the operating system. Look to the additional information provided to determine the cause of the problem.

As a temporary measure, you can silence the warning by adding the following value to your project file:

```xml
<!-- Comment out or set to 'false' to get warnings about TLB conversion -->
<ResolveComReferenceSilent>true</ResolveComReferenceSilent>
```

> [!WARNING]
> We don't recommend suppressing MSBuild diagnostic information. Eliminating the warning doesn't address the underlying problem. Using the ResolveComReferenceSilent property to hide the warning might also hide other COM reference warnings you don't intend to suppress.
