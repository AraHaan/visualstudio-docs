# MSB3305

This article describes the MSB3305 error code.

## Message text

`MSB3305: Processing COM reference 'reference' from path 'path'.`

## Description

This warning is a generic notification of an issue with a COM reference. Some possible causes include:

- An invalid type library (TLB file), which might be anything from a corrupt TLB file to a version mismatch.
- Types in a TLB that can't be converted to .NET types. The unconverted types are passed as pointers, which requires the use of unsafe code.

## Resolution

The standard output message text is followed by additional information from the operating system. Look to the additional information provided to determine the cause of the problem.

As a temporary measure, you can silence the warning by adding the following value to your project file:

```xml
<!-- Comment out or set to 'false' to get warnings about TLB conversion -->
<ResolveComReferenceSilent>true</ResolveComReferenceSilent>
```

> [!WARNING]
> As you work to resolve this MSBuild error, avoid some common techniques that can cause you to miss vital information:
>
> - Suppression of MSBuild diagnostic information
> - Use of the `ResolveComReferenceSilent` property to hide the MSB3305 warning
