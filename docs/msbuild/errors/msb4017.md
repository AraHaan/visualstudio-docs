## Description

This error occurs when a logger fails while logging an event, most likely because of a programming error in the logger. When a logger encounters a fatal error, MSBuild can't continue with the build, and you get this error. The message text from MSBuild is followed by the exception or error from the logger.

## Resolution

If this is occurring when using your own custom logger, you have to debug the logger itself to diagnose and fix the error, and then rebuild the logger and try building again.

If this occurs with a built-in logger, then it's either an engineering defect in MSBuild, or a system issue such as an out-of-memory error. If you suspect an MSBuild bug, see [Report a problem](../../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md), or enter an issue at [https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild].
