## Message text

## Description

An SDK resolver assembly is an assembly that is loaded when an SDK is referenced in a project file. The purpose of the resolve assembly is to find and load the appropriate SDK. If this error occurs, it means that the resolver assembly couldn't be located.

## Resolution

This error should never occur if you're using `dotnet build` or Visual Studio to run MSBuild, but it could occur in a custom tool that uses the MSBuild API to perform a build and doesn't locate the right MSBuild installation files. The recommended way to locate MSBuild is to use <xref:Microsoft.Build.Locator.MSBuildLocator>. For detailed instructions, see [Find and use MSBuild versions](../find-and-use-msbuild-versions.md).
