## Description

This error occurs in the [ResolveManifest task](../resolvemanifestfiles-task.md), which collects all the information, artifacts, and resources to generate a ClickOnce manifest. The error occurs when there's a problem with something that was required for the manifest generation.

## Resolution

Turn on verbose diagnostics (`-v:diag`), or generate a binary log and view it in the [Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com). Find the place in the log where the `ResolveManifest` task is invoked. Check the input to the     `ResolveManifest` task and verify the correctness and validity of all the inputs.

If you changed the publishing settings in Visual Studio, review them for errors. In .NET Framework projects, go to **Project Properties** > **Publish** > **Application Files**, and review the settings. Try selecting the **Reset All** button to see if the project builds and publishes with default settings.

For more information, see [Specify files to publish](../../deployment/how-to-specify-which-files-are-published-by-clickonce.md).
