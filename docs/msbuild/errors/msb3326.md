## Description

This error occurs if you enabled the **Sign the ClickOnce manifests** feature, and the `.pfx` file specified for ClickOnce manifest signing isn't found in your certificate store when MSBuild attempts to publish the manifest. During the publish process, if MSBuild encounters a problem and you specified a `.pfx` file (with the **Select from File** option), MSBuild tries to import the `.pfx` certificate file into the user's certificate store. You might get this error if the `.pfx` is password-protected.

## Resolution

To resolve the error, manually import the `.pfx` file into your certificate store. For more information, see [Importing an SPC into a certificate store](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/importing-an-spc-into-a-certificate-store) and [How to: Sign application and deployment manifests](../../ide/how-to-sign-application-and-deployment-manifests.md).
