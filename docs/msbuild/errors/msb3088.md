## Message text

<!-- :::editable-content name="messageText"::: -->
`MSB3088: Could not read state file 'file-path'.`
<!-- :::editable-content-end::: -->
<!-- MSB3088: Could not read state file "{0}". {1} -->

## Description

MSBuild uses certain files called state files to cache information between one build session and another. This information is used to avoid repeating analysis done in a previous run, and thereby improve performance. For example, information about referenced assemblies is reused when referenced assemblies haven't changed between builds to avoid having to repeat the same dependency analysis each time you build.

This message is shown when a one of the state files couldn't be read, for any reason. It may be followed by a message from the operating system that gives more information about what the problem was.

## Resolution

This condition doesn't block the build, since MSBuild simply repeats the analysis that was cached, so your project still builds even if this message appears. However, it might mean builds could be faster if the root of the problem is found and fixed.

Look to the error message from the operating system to understand what the root cause of the problem is and how to fix it.
