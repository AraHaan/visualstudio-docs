## Description

This error occurs when the [Copy task](../copy-task.md) is provided a path to a directory in the `SourceFiles` parameter. Since the MSBuild `Copy` task doesn't support copying directories, this is an error.

## Resolution

If you control the build logic where the `Copy` task is used, check your logic that creates the inputs for the `SourceFiles` parameter to see whether the paths you're providing are the ones you intended. If your intention is to copy the contents of a directory, the `SourceFiles` parameter of the `Copy` task should be an item that includes the files in the directory.

This situation can easily occur in a build system if the folder structure changes and what was a path to a file is now a path to a folder. Update path inputs such as environment variables, command lines, and MSBuild properties to account for the new folder structure.
