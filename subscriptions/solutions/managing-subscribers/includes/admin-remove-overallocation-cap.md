## How do I remove the default overallocation cap?

Default overallocation restrictions are in place to protect agreements from assigning far more subscriptions than were purchased. If you have a legitimate business case for overallocating more subscriptions, contact support using one of the links in the "Still need help" section, requesting the cap be lifted and provide a business justification for doing so.
