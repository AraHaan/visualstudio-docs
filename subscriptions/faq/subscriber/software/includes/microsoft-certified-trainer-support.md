## Visual Studio Subscription Issues?

If you're an MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainer), have a valid Vision Studio subscription, and are experiencing issues with your Visual Studio subscription, submit a ticket via the MCT support portal at <https://aka.ms/NewMCTSupport>.

Provide the following details in your ticket:
+ Your full name and MCT ID
+ A detailed description of the issue
+ Any error messages or screenshots (if applicable)
+ The email address associated with your Visual Studio subscription account

After submitting your ticket, you'll receive a confirmation email. A support representative will review your case and respond with next steps or a resolution.

For the fastest resolution, ensure all required information is included when submitting your request.

**If you are a newly enrolled MCT, please do not submit a support ticket asking about your Visual Studio subscription. The MCT Program team will contact you directly once your Visual Studio subscription has been activated.**
