## What does it mean when the portal says I have "reached the default overallocation cap?"

Default overallocation restrictions are in place to protect agreements from assigning far more subscriptions than were purchased. If you have a legitimate business case for overallocating more subscriptions, our [support team can assist you](https://manage.visualstudio.com/GetHelp/AssistedSupport?mkt). Select your agreement ID, set "Managing subscribers" as your category, and "How do I remove the default overallocation cap?" as your question.
